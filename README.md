  The era of static programs is meeting its end, mankind is about to embrace a new world pioneered by organic programs/cyber-creatures that are "alive" (it can self-heal and self-improve). to hatch such creature we need a special environment and that's what this project for.
  Such future is inevitable so why not control it by making it happen.
