# cocktailvm - A distributed VM for Code As State
  The era of static programs is meeting its end, mankind is about to see a new world pioneered by organic programs/cyber-creatures that are "alive" (it can self-heal and self-improve). Such future is inevitable so why not control it by making it happen. To hatch such creature we need a special environment and that's what this project for.
