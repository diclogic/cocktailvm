# Nesting invocation
#* Priority: 1
#* Targets:
#** a chronon can call another chronon
#** a function can be either chronon or non-chronon 

# Readonly states as parameters
#* Priority: 1

# State Migration
#* Priority: 1
#* Targets:
#** the ability of states to migrate to another Spacetime(ST)
#** such change to Spacetimes(departuring and arriving) should also be tracked in the same way as other chronons
#** 

# Defragment of ITC
#* Priority: 5
#* Desc:
#** because of the nature of the ITC (it's a binary tree), ITC utilizes this fact to reduce entropy of unnecessary versioning detail
#** over thousands of state migrations the tree would contain lots of fragment
#** the difficulty here is: the ITC tree is global, so how can we rehash it efficiently 

# Spacetime replica
#* Priority: 9
#* Desc:
#** having replica can help to achieve necessary data redundency for failover and parallel readable source
